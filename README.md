## Introduction

Understanding risk is central to any investment endeavor. Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously stated:

"The first rule of investment is don't lose. The second rule is don't forget the first rule."

To understand risk, one must examine the statistical properties of return distributions, which is a notoriously difficult task.

In undergraduate finance-courses, the tools commonly taught, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Sharpe Ratio, rely on first- and second-order statistics (variance and standard deviation), while ignoring higher-order effects. A distribution fully described by these lower-order moments is known as Gaussian (or Normal).

However, in practice, stock returns are not Gaussian â€” a fact well established in financial research.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate this deviation from normality and explore alternative models that better capture the true nature of financial returns.
